2. Open cmd/bash and run the below command:<br>
On Mac/Win: ``git clone https://github.com/sprakshith/CreditScoringSystem.git``
<br><br>
3. Now create a virtual enviroment. <br>
On Mac: ``python3 -m venv ./venv``<br>
Example: ``python3 -m venv ./venv``
<br><br>
On Win: ``python -m venv  "[Path to weather-pipeline Directory]\[NAME_OF_VIRTUAL_ENV]"``<br>
Example: ``python -m venv "D:\weather-pipeline\venv"``
<br><br>
4. To activate the venv run the below command. <br>
On Mac: ``source venv/bin/activate`` <br>
On Win: ``venv\Scripts\activate``
<br><br>
5. To install all the requirements run the below command. Execute this command whenever there is a change in requirements.txt file.<br>
On Mac/Win: ``pip install -r requirements.txt``
